# shop4u â€” Static starter

Simple static e-commerce starter.

## Structure
See the tree in the project root. Put assets (images, css, js) in `assets/`.

## How to run
Open `index.html` in a browser. For development consider a local static server:
- `npx serve` or `python -m http.server 8000`

## Notes
- All pages link to `assets/css/style.css` and `assets/js/main.js`.
- Replace placeholder images under `assets/img/`.
- Add backend endpoints for contact, cart, and checkout as needed.
